reasoning and understanding, can unlock unprecedented possibilities in solving complex problems.\n       Specifically in fields that can have an actual positive impact on people's daily lives,\n        such as research and medical fields that seems to be falling behind in favor of fancier AI chatbots and image generators!\n  \n      Our mission is to move toward this goal by completing the development of the AgentFusion-framework.\n       an Agentic framework that's been built to be scalable , designed for interconnected collaboration,\n       and aims to unifies power of Agentic rag systems with knowledge-graph in a limited reasoning space (small-language-models) .\n  \n      Even though this framework been built to be a research tool it has other/casual daily use-cases\n       like converting unstructured raw data like random texts or images to memory-nodes in the knowledge-graph\n       which makes them searchable as easy as a drag and drop ,\n       AgentFusion does the understanding and captioning for you in the background .\n  \n      We offer multiple options for various use-cases :\n      - @groq : where speed matters\n      - @ollama and @llamacpp : where you want local and private models\n  \n      We also support different reasoning and toolcall models :\n      - like @DeepSeek, @qwen, @phi , @llama\n  \n      And also multiple rag mode like:\n      - liteRag : when you need good old simple and quick retrievals\n      - agenticRag : when you want full potential of AgentFusion like agentic workflow and high performance.\n  \n      this way everyone can make sense of their data in a free and private  framework .\n  \n      we've just started and our first step is to make this platform mature enough to make its development as smooth as possible.\n        but many more features like Deep-Research,analyzing and editing and our specific models ... are on the way\n  \n      please consider supporting us in social media:","the helperApp can
